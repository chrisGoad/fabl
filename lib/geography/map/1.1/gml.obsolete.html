<a href = "http://www.opengis.org/techno/documents/02-023r4.pdf">GML</a> is the XML language for geography developed by the Open GIS consortium. The third major revision
of this specification, known as GML3, was  released in January of 2003.  
<a href = "revision2.html">RDFMap</a>, when used in conjuction with <a href="/rdfgeom2d1.0/revision2.html">RDFGeom2d</a>, consitutes an
attempt to develop an alternative  approach based on RDF to 
expressing geographical information.
This note outlines the relationship between this approach
and GML, and suggests techniques for   
converting data between the two formalisms. The important differences
between RDFMap and GML derive from the choice of RDF, and
would apply equally to other RDF-based formalisms for geography.<p>

These are the  differences:<p>

<b>Data model and type system</b><p>

GML is built on the XML data model and the XML Schema type system.<p>

RDFMap is built on
the RDF data model. RDFS or OWL can be used to express typing information for RDFMap 
content.  <p>

The RDF formalisms for data and types are substantially simpler than their
XML counterparts. <p>

<b>Composability</b><p>

RDFMap, like any other RDF vocabulary, allows free composition with other RDF languages.
Geographic assertions can be mixed with assertions about  weather, physics, business processes,
weblogs and syndication, genealogy, politics, and so on, without the need for prior coordination between
the designers of languages for these domains.  In the case of RDFMap, even geometry is relegated to
a separate language (RDFGeom2d).<p>


In contrast, GML is not directly composable with other XML languages.  Entities that are described 
by other languages cannot legally play the role of geographic features in GML. This because
all types of geographic features are required to derive from the GML abstract class 
<b>gml:AbstractFeatureType</b>.
Even if it were not for this formal requirement, the lack of conventions about how to
represent even simple semantic notions in XML languages would prevent effective
integration of GML with XML languages developed independently.
<p>
The non-composability of GML requires that it absorb as application schemas
the multitude of 
other domains to which geographical information is relevant. Failing this,
non-standard mechanisms of some kind must be used to relate GML content with
external data.<p>
  Indeed, GML positions itself as 
a universal, rather
than geography-specific,  semantic standard  by including its own general formalisms for 
collections, assertion of properties (in a style
very much like RDF), time and processes, and reference between content in separate files
(via Xlink).  GML can be viewed as an alternative not just to geography in 
RDF, but to RDF itself.   <p>

<b>Maturity</b><p>

The application of RDF to geography is at an  early stage<sup><a href = "#foot1">[1]</a></sup>, whereas GML
is a mature effort.
RDFMap combined with the
 companion RDFGeom2d language
cover only a fraction of the ground covered by GML3.  This is partly
because GML3 addresses other topics, such as topology, time and processes, and
observations, that are not proper to the domain
of geography. These are  or will be  covered by other vocabularies
in the composable world of RDF.
There is one area included in GML3 but not RDFMap that is often
regarded as a proper part of geography,
and is of great practical importance: coverages. A coverage
is a mechanism for assigning data systematically to a set of points
or areas that (usually) take a regular form such as grid or triangulation.
Finally, GML's treatment of temporal matters and of observations is careful to
support what is needed for geography, even if time and observation are not
inherently geographical concepts. So, to match GML3 completely, feature for feature,
within the RDF world will involve substantial effort.<p>





 However, there are two points favoring the immediate applicabilty of RDFMap and
 RDFGeom2d.  First, RDFGeom2d, though new, is essentially a port
 of SVG geometry, and SVG is a mature and widely implemented specification.
 Second,
 RDFMap and RDFGeom2d are adequate
 as they stand to formulate much of the geographical information that
 is in exchanged in standard formats today.  GML is not yet widely used in 
 practice, and GML3 in particular is very early in the adoption process.
 The standards that are widely used include formats such as ESRI shapefiles,
 and USGS DEMs (digital elevation models).  In the near term, interoperability with these older
 standards 
 will be of greater practical importance than interoperability with
 GML, though this will shift with growing adoption of GML. RDFMap and RDFGeom2d
 suffice already to cover the expressiveness of shapefiles, 
 in which a vast amount of 
 GIS data is available. Relatively modest efforts in the direction of coverages
 will suffice for DEMs.<p>

 <p>

<b>Data conversion</b><p>

GML applications are developed by combining  XML schemas from
the GML standard  with application schemas that capture the relevant
types and properties of the target domain. In the RDF world, the role of an application schema is played by 
a domain-specific vocabulary that 
is mixed with RDFMap 
to represent geographic information about objects in the domain. 
<!--Application schemas must be built from types that are derived from
GML abstract types, but there is no corresponding requirement for RDF.--><p>

Standard conversion techniques can be developed for  the feature and 
geometry schemas in GML. Development of 
domain specific
vocabularies in RDF corresponding to application schemas is also needed,
 and this
part of the job requires separate treatment for each schema. Fortunately,
a core requirement of GML is that information be represented in 
<a href = "http://www.w3.org/2001/10/stripes/">"striped"</a>
form by
asserting values of properties on objects (as in RDF). It will often
be possible to port an application schema to an RDF vocabulary 
by giving RDF (ie URI) names to the properties and types in the schema.
This will allow instance data to be converted.  <p>

<i>Type-level conversion</i><p>
Converting instance data is not the only issue for interoperability between
GML and RDF, though it is certainly the primary issue for practical purposes.
There is also the matter of 
mirroring GML type definitions in the RDF world. In GML,definition
of types - that 
 is, characterization of the form of correct instance data - is handled
by XML Schema - a very complex formalism.  The two predominant typing formalisms
for RDF are RDFS (RDF schema), and OWL. OWL is the appropriate choice for this
job, since its expressiveness corresponds more closely to that of XML Schema.  <p>

However, practical
applications do not always - in fact, do not usually - require 
definition of types; naming the types is adequate.
Type definition serves the purpose of validation, and in some cases,
support for automated reasoning ( particularly on the RDF side), but
practical development of software involving instance data can proceed
without formalizing the constraints that define  types.
Type definitions have not yet been developed for RDFMap or RDFGeom2d. 
So, type-level conversion between GML and RDFMap is a topic for the future.<p>

<i>Conversion of geometry</i><p>

SVG is a natural choice for display of maps, and the conversion of GIS formats including GML to SVG has
recieved substantial attention and effort. 
Since RDFGeom2d is an RDF reformulation of SVG geometry, converting to RDFMap+RDFGeom2d presents
no new obstacles, and will not require a major effort to implement. <p>

<i> An example</i><p>

The venerable (and simple) Cambridge example has appeared in each version of the GML specification.
It  includes a minimal application schema for city features,
and a brief data file describing two roads in Cambridge and the river Cam.  
The application schema used can be found on page 420 of the
GML document.  The schema introduces the types CityModelType, RoadType, RiverType, and MountainType (even though there is
no mountain within 50 kilometers of Cambridge). The following files illustrate conversion of this
simple data to RDFMap.<p>

different technical choices. The most important  difference between RDFMap and
