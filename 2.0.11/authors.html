<p>Chris Goad designed and implemented Fabl, with some code in the C kernel
adapted from earlier work by Andrew Burgess. More specifically, the Fabl garbage collector and 
virtual machine draw on techniques used in implementing the Umbel language, an  ancestor of Fabl
whose C kernel was designed and coded by Andrew Burgess.
