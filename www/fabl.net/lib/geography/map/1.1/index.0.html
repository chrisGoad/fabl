<b>RDFmap</b> defines a simple set of  <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> classes and properties 
for geography. 
When used with other modules, <b>RDFMap</b> supports adding geographical information
to all kinds resources.  For example, the use of <b>RDFMap</b> in conjunction with  <a href="http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/">RSS</a>,
<a href="http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/dc/">Dublin Core</a>, and 
<a href="../rdfgeom1.0/index.html">RDFGeom</a>, allows 
assignment of geographical locations to weblog entries (see <a href="http://www.blogmapper.com">blogmapper</a> for an example). 
<b>RDFMap</b> also includes classes for 
describing the relationship between maps and the areas on the earth surface that they depict. 
See this <a href = "gml.html">document</a> for a comparison between  <b>RDFMap</b>, and 
<a href = "<a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/docs/02-023r4.pdf">GML</a>, the XML language for geography
developed by the Open GIS consortium.<p>


This specification is brief and simple because it treats
only the <i>connections</i> between things and geography. It does not involve itself in
describing 
the  things themselves,
nor describing the geometry of their earthly forms, but only in making
 statements of the form "this thing has that geometry on the earth", or "this map covers
 that area on the earth".
 This way of doing things allows indepedent evolution and
 reuse of the related vocabularies, such as <a href="../rdfgeom1.0/index.html">RDFGeom</a> for geometry.<p>

<a href = "http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#">WGS84 Geo</a>
 is an even simpler vocabulary for defining geographical locations of
RDF resources. It defines classes <b>SpatialThing</b> and <b>Point</b>, and properties 
<b>lat</b> (latitude), <b>long</b> (longitude), and <b>alt</b> (altitude). 
Applications that only require assigment
of point locations to resources
in wgs84 latitude/longitude coordinates should use the
simpler <b>Geo</b>
vocabulary. <b>RDFMap</b> supports assigning more complex geometry, use of other
datums and cartographic projections, and descriptions of maps.  <p>
Due to the composability of
RDF vocabularies, <b>RDFMap</b> and <b>WGS84 Geo</b> can be freely intermixed 
in RDF documents, and it is intended
that applications
that support <b>RDFMap</b> include support for <b>WGS84 Geo</b> as well - allowing
the simplest facts to be expressed in the simplest way.<p>



<b>RDFMap</b> is  compliant with the recommendations for 
<a href="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/">RSS 1.0 modules</a>.<p>


<!--
<b>RDFMap</b> depends on <a href="RDFGeom2d.html">RDFGeom2d</a> for the definition of the classes <b>Point</b> and
<b>Box</b> and their properties. <p>
-->

<!--<b>Rationale for a separate geometry specification</b>-->
<p>


<!--  An immediate instance of this saving might be the construction of RDF vocabularies
for both images (RDFized SVG) and comprehensive GIS (RDFized GML)
based on a common RDF vocabulary for geometry.<p>
-->




<!--
 and this
restriction allows for 
an extremely compact and simple formulation, in the tradition
of RSS.
-->
<a name = "example1">

Here is an  <b>RDFMap</b> file containing one RSS item.</a>
<p>



<pre class="example">

        &lt;geom:x&gt;-123.817&lt;/geom:x&gt;
        &lt;geom:y&gt;46.183&lt;/geom:y&gt;
     &lt;/geom2d:Point&gt;
  &lt;/dc:coverage&gt;
&lt;/rss:item&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
</pre>
<p>

This RDF signifies that the specified RSS item pertains to a particular point on the
earth's surface, namely the point in the WGS84 spatial reference system with x (longitude) equal to
-123.817, and y (latitude) equal to 46.183. See <a href = "#srs">below</a> for details about the <b>srs</b> (spatial
reference system) property.<p>


Note  that <b>dc:coverage</b> is defined as follows 
 in <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/2003/02/04/dces/">http://dublincore.org/documents/2003/02/04/dces/</a>:
 <p>

 "Coverage will typically include spatial location (a place name
               or geographic coordinates), ..."<p>


So, in this example, the <b>RDFMap</b> vocabulary was only needed to specify a spatial reference system for a point;
other vocabularies did the rest of the work.<p>

While <b>dc:coverage</b> is adequate to define the simplest geographical property of
a thing - its location - additional vocabulary is needed to cover other basic
relationships between things and geometry.<p>

Now, here is the list of properties and classes making up <b>RDFMap</b>.
The names "boundedBy", "edgeOf", "centerLineOf", and "srs" appear in the GML specification
with similar meanings.<p>

Property:<b>srs</b></a><p>
<dd>


The <b>srs</b> of a geometric object specifies
the spatial reference system that interprets coordinates
as points on the earth.  Such reference systems
include
map projections (such as Transverse Mercator or Albers Equal-Area),
and  "datums" (such as NAD27, NAD83, and WGS84) which model
the earth as a ellipsoid with parameters that vary slightly from datum
to datum.  The value of <b>srs</b> is the URI of a resource representing
a reference system.   

<p>

An <a href="http://www.opengis.org">Open GIS</a> standard for defining spatial reference systems is 
<a href = "http://www.opengis.org/techno/specs/01-009.pdf">available</a>. However, the 
specification (and the subject matter which it formalizes) is complex, and the great 
majority of applications
can be served adequately by the use of standard names for the commonly
used projections.
As part of this specification, we designate the URI<p>

 http://fabl.net/vocabularies/geography/SRSCatalog<p>

as the parent beneath which SRSs are named.
The most commonly used SRS's can be specified
via their EPSG (European Petroleum Survey Group) codes.  
  The SRS with EPSG code <b>&lt;N&gt;</b> is named
"epsg<b>&lt;N&gt;</b>".
(A listing of EPSG codes
can be found at 
<a href="http://www.inovagis.org/giserver/epsg.asp">http://www.inovagis.org/giserver/epsg.asp</a>.)
For example, <p>
http://fabl.net/vocabularies/geography/SRSCatalog/epsg32610 <p>

denotes UTM zone 10N, the universal transverse mercator zone for points 
in the northern hemisphere  between 120 and 126 degrees west longitude (eg San Francisco).
The UTM projections are suitable for maps that cover areas of up to a few hundred miles 
on a side (except at latitudes near the poles).
  
We also specify that UTM zone &lt;N&gt; is designated by  "utm&lt;N&gt;n", or
"utm&lt;N&gt;s" for the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively (eg utm10n for the
zone which includes San Francisco), and that "wgs84" denotes the WGS84 datum.
<p>

<!--
The srs 

http://fabl.net/vocabularies/RDFMap/SRSCatalog/canvas


means that points are to be interpreted directly in the coordinates
of the map upon which they are displayed, that is,
in "canvas coordinates" (as explained <a href="#canvas">below</a>).<p>
-->

Programmers who use <b>RDFMap</b> will rarely have any need
to understand the intricate details of these 
spatial reference systems, but will sometimes need access to a library
of functions for transforming points between them.  End users of systems based
on <b>RDFMap</b> normally won't need to concern themselves with spatial reference systems at all.
<p>

The <b>srs</b> property can be applied to such geometric entities as <b>Points</b> and <b>Boxes</b>,
with the effect that the coordinates of the entities in question are to be interpreted as points
on the earth under the specified projection. The example appearing <a href="#example1">above</a> 
illustrates this. <p>
<dt>
<a name="map">
Class:<b>Map</b></a><p>

<dd>
A map is regarded for the current purposes as something that depicts geographically located
<i>content</i> in a particular way on a two dimensional <i>canvas</i> - usually on a computer
screen.  So, to describe a map is a matter of listing the content to be displayed, and specifying
the geometric transformation from real-world coordinates to canvas coordinates. This specification
includes only two content-related properties - <b>basemap</b> and <b>thumbnail</b>. Other kinds of content will generally
described using other RDF languages proper to the kinds of geographical entities involved.<p>  

<dt>
Property:<b>basemap</b>;   range = <b>image file</b><p>
<dd>
This specifies a background image for the map. The value of the property
should be a web resource containing an image, such as a JPEG, PNG, SWF, or SVG file.<p>

<dt>
Property:<b>thumbnail</b>;   range = <b>image file</b><p>
<dd>
<b>thumbnail</b> specifies a small image used to denote the map in web documents.
<p>

<!--Often, but not always, a map will be a web resource given by URL 
(eg <a href = "http://www.blogmapper.com/sfbase.swf">
http://www.blogmapper.com/sfbase.swf</a>). -->
 Following <a href = "http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/">SVG</a> terminology, 
the map is visualized as a viewport
onto an infinite two-dimensional surface called the "canvas".  
Most maps will also have an <b>srs</b>
property, which specifies the datum and projection used for representing
points on the earth that are depicted by the map.
Determining the point on a map
corresponding to  a point on the earth is a matter of first 
computing its coordinates in the SRS of the map,
and then  perfoming an affine transformation (scaling and offset)
to render the point in canvas coordinates.  For projections whose axes
approximately align with lines of longitude and latitude, the x coordinate is
taken to mean longitude and y latitude.  The output of the affine transformation is
in a right-handed coordinate system with x pointing to the right and y up.
(Most graphics applications need to flip y before display, since screen coordinates
usually have y pointing down).<p>

 The affine transformation is described by the following properties:<p>



<dt>
Property:<b>coverage</b>; range = <b>geom2d:Box</b> for the domain <b>Map</b><p>
<dt>
Property:<b>extent</b>; range = <b>geom2d:Box</b> for the domain <b>Map</b><p>


<dd>

The <b>coverage</b> of a map specifies the range of points on the earth
that the map covers, using the map's <b>srs</b>, and the <b>extent</b>
is the  box representing the map's viewport onto the canvas.<p>


<dt>
Property:<b>canvas</b>;   range = <b>Map</b><p>

<dd>
This property is an alternative to <b>srs</b>, and is applicable to
any located entity (such as a <b>Point</b> or an RSS channel or item, or even
another <b>Map</b>). If a resource has the <b>canvas</b> property, 
the values of the <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> properties of its contents are interpreted in the canvas
coordinates of the map that is the value of <b>canvas</b>.<p>



<dt>
Property:<b>useMap</b> range:<b>Map</b><p>

<dd>
The <b>useMap</b> property asserts that its value is a map that can be used
to depict its subject.  For example, an RSS channel might have a <b>useMap</b>
property whose value is a  map  recommended for
depicting
the contents of the channel.
</dl>




<h3>Usage with RSS</h3><p>


<b>RDFMap</b> can be used in conjunction with either 
<a href="http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/">RSS 1.0</a> or 
<a href="http://backend.userland.com/rss">RSS 2.0</a> (but not RSS 0.9*). RSS 1.0
is an RDF vocabulary, so  assigning <b>RDFMap</b> properties to RSS 1.0 resources presents
no obstacle.    RSS 2.0 allows inclusion of elements not defined in the RSS 2.0 specification, as
long as those elements are defined in namespaces. <b>RDFMap</b> properties may be asserted
of RSS 2.0 channels or items simply by including the relevant property elements.
Here is a legal RSS 2.0 fragment of this kind:<p>

<pre class="example">
&lt;item&gt;
   &lt;description&gt;In golden gate park&lt;/description&gt;
   &lt;dc:coverage&gt;
      &lt;geom:Point&gt;
         &lt;map:srs rdf:resource=
             "http://fabl.net/vocabularies/geography/SRSCatalog/utm10n"/&gt;
         &lt;geom:x&gt;545806&lt;/geom:x&gt;
         &lt;geom:y&gt;4180610&lt;/geom:y&gt;
      &lt;/geom:Point&gt;
   &lt;/dc:coverage&gt;
   &lt;pubDate&gt;Wed, 31 Jul 2002 17:07 +0000&lt;/pubDate&gt;
&lt;/item&gt;
</pre>
<p>
 
In either RSS 1.0 or RSS 2.0, a channel can be assigned a <b>map:useMap</b> property which specifies how its items are to
be mapped. As illustrated more than once above, each item or channel may have a <b>dc:coverage</b> property belonging to a
geometric  class such as <b>geom2d:Point</b>
indicating the geometry that should be displayed when that item
is mapped. <p>


It is common for RSS items to have other properties that are relevant to mapping.
For example, the <b>dc:type</b> property
may specify 
the category of entity described by an item.  The map implementation
is free to exploit this category information in defining map layers.<p>


The following convention is  a part of this specification: 
whenever a container of some
kind is assigned an <b>srs</b> (resp. <b>canvas</b>), its contents are to use that 
<b>srs</b> (resp. <b>canvas</b>)
as the default.  For example, if a channel is assigned an <b>srs</b>,
then its items may be assigned locations which fail to specify 
<b>srs</b>s individually. Then, the <b>srs</b> of the channel is used
to interpret these locations.<p>

These techniques are illustrated by <a href ="http://www.blogmapper.com">Blogmapper</a>,
an application which uses <b>RDFMap</b> and RSS to map the contents of weblogs.<p>

<h3> Implementation notes </h3>


The intention of the <b>RDFMap</b> specification is to allow resources of all kinds
to be annotated with  location information, not to specify in detail how
this information is to displayed.  In this respect as in others it follows
the example of RSS, which specifies content only, and not presentation.
Just as there are many RSS viewers, so it is to be hoped that
over time many <b>RDFMap</b> viewers
will be developed with functionality adapted to various specialized applications.<p>


Here's an example of an <a href="astoria.0.xml">RDFMap file</a> that
describes a map of Astoria, Oregon.  <p>

   <a name = "foot1" id = "foot1">
<span class="footnote">[1]A modification in an RDF vocabulary is called
a <i>revision</i> rather than a new <i>version</i> if it adds to the vocabulary
without changing the meaning of preexisting terms.

</span></a>
<!-- Note
that the <b>dc:</b> properties are used for assiging titles and descriptions, rather than the <b>rss:</b>
variants.  This follows the policy of Sjoerd Visscher's xslt 
<a href="http://w3future.com/weblog/2002/09/09.html#a129">transformation</a> from
rss 0.9x,2.0 into RDF. Note that Visscher's transformer can be used in conjunction with
<b>RDFMap</b> to map contents of weblogs in rss 0.9x, 2.0.


<a name = "changes"/>
 <h3>Changes in version 1.0</h3><p>
(1) Separated out geometry primitives into <b>RDFGeom2d</b>. (2) Removed auxilliary non-RDF
specification for RSS 0.9* (since RSS 2.0 admits foreign elements), (3) Minor changes to the <b>Map</b> class:
now the basemap image is specified explicitly, as is a thumbnail. (4) Deleted the <b>location</b> property
in favor of the Dublin Core <b>coverage</b> property.<p>
